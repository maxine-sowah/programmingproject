    <h1>"To Straighten or Not to Straighten"</h1>
    <h2>By Maxine Sowah</h2>
    <p> Willow is starting at a new school and she can't wait. Which means that she has to figure out what to do to her hair. She asks her mother if she can wear her hair in two puffs. Her mother asks her if she would rather straighten it so she can make a good first impression. However, Willow wants her hair in the two puffs, but maybe her mother was right... she didn't want to block anyone's view with her hair. </p>
